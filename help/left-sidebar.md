# Left sidebar

The left sidebar in the Zulip web and desktop apps helps you navigate your
conversations. It has three main sections:

- **Views** provide various ways to get an overview of your messages.
- The **direct messages** section shows your [direct
  message](/help/direct-messages) conversations.
- The **channels** section shows the [channels](/help/introduction-to-channels)
  you are subscribed to.

You can adjust the left sidebar to focus on the information you need right now
by:

- Expanding or collapsing the **Views** section.
- Expanding or collapsing the **Direct messages** section.
- Showing all topics in a channel.
- [Configuring unread message counters](/help/configure-unread-message-counters).
- Hiding the left sidebar altogether.

You can also customize how channels are organized within the **channels**
section by:

- [Pinning channels](/help/pin-a-channel) so that they appear in the top section.
- [Changing channel colors](/help/change-the-color-of-a-channel).
- [Configuring](/help/manage-inactive-channels) whether inactive channels are
  sorted at the bottom.
